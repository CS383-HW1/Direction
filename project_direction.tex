\begin{section}{Mason Fabel}
Our project is to be ``a turn-based co-operative multiplayer
'dungeon-crawl' role-playing game'', combining the ideas of an adventurous
science fiction setting and the premise of a lowly office worker rising
through the ranks to become the master of his own destiny.

While contemplating these goals, I came up with a few central concepts and
observations I would like to see incorporated into the final project.

\begin{subsection}{Tone and Theme}
While there are a lot of directions the overall tone and feel of this projecan take, I believe the best direction would be a lighthearted combination of comedy, in the vein of Douglass Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide, and
action/adventure, such as in Star Wars IV.

Taking this approach instead of a realistic approach gives the team more
freedom as to the shape of the final project. As we are not constrained by
accurately simulating reality, we can instead focus on creating a game that
is fun to play and avoid complicating areas that would not benifit from
such attentions.

Keeping a light tone will allow us to avoid dark or overly thoughtful
material. While this things have a time and a place, the purpose
of this project is to learn how to organize and create large pieces of
software, not to create an artistic of philosophical statement. By avoiding
such material, the focus is kept on the engineering, where it should be,
instead of the content, which is a matter for a different class.
